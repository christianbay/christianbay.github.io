Before I go to bed. I need to create some sort of system that will allow me to post from my phone etc.
I think I can do that with something like crontab polling my Dropbox/iCloud. Probably harder with iCloud,
but I really don't want to go back to syncing my Writer documents on Dropbox. Actually, that isn't happening.  
  
You know what's going to be painful? Having to manually control the damn line-breaks. Whatever. I'll get used to it (or find a workaround).
