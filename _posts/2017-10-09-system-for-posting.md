In Zero To One by Peter Thiel, it says that the next Facebook won't be a social network.
I think the next big thing won't even be a company. We're constantly thinking about
companies, about profit. Well guess what, I'm tired of profit. We don't need more money.
Individuals do not need a lot of money. We don't need most of the stuff we consume.
It's a system that feeds itself. We use advertising to make people desire things, so
that we can do a wealth transfer between individuals. People do not actually want those
things, you are tricking them into wanting it. Ok, so fuck companies. It's all rotten.  
  
What's next? Something that isn't a company. Is it a non-profit? Perhaps, but not the
kind of non-profit we see today. I think something in between. Non-profits that sell
things and generate revenue, but that don't make any profit. Now that's interesting.
