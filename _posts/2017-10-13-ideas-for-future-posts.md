This post will only serve as a list of things that I want to post about at some
point in the future. I will nudge it to the top every time I update it. 
  
- Designer babies
- Humans are machines
- The right to suicide
- Life's role in entropy
- Fashioning tools to overcome anxiety
- The anxiety of God: God's imminent fear of not being God
