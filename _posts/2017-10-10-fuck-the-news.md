A lot of people read the news every day. Fuck the news. The news are not important.
It seems most people have the idea that reading the news is a good thing. They pride
themselves on 'being aware of what is happening in the world'. Moronic. Have you even
thought it through?  
First of all, most sites just reprint what every one else is printing. Why? Second,
most news are financed by ads. This means that they make money when they get *clicks*.
If you add those two together you'll find a huge *bias*! You aren't reading what you
*should* be reading in the news. It's all populism! Ask yourself, why aren't we putting
the hard problems of our times on print? It's because you won't click on it. People don't 
like bad news. **People do not want the truth**.  
How often do you seek the truth? I mean 
*really* seek the truth? On a fundamental level, you don't care. You just want
entertainment, and so that's what you'll get. You click on shit, so there's shit everywhere. 
Congratulations!  
I don't read the news. Fuck the news.
