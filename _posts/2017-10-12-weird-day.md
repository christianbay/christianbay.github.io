It's been a long short day. A weird day. Earlier today I figured that I didn't
like being on the computer during the day, so I played music instead. I spent
most my energy writing a new song. At 18.30 I went to go climbing. Initially
I had some exuses as to why I didn't need to go. I'm glad I went, I stayed for
3 hours and it was a lot of fun.  
When I got home I had some excuses as to why I didn't have to make dinner, so
I made dinner. Ricealicious, soooo. You know. Delicious. Anyway, now it's past
midnight, and I had some excuses as to why I didn't need to write any code, so...
I'm writing code.
