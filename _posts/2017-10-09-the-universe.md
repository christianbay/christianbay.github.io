The universe, life, is profoundly sad  
Here now, only to be erased,  
By the razorblade of time  

What are even dreams,  
But nights cruel mistress,  
Painting hope, on our days  

Can we even move,  
But in lock-step with it all  
Again -- and again,  
It comes to break my heart  

I wrote this poem about one year ago. I think it's the best I've ever written.  
Listening to Written On The Sky by Max Richter it sprung into existense.
