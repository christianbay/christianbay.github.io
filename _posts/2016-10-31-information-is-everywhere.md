title: Information is everywhere

What does a view, a picture on the wall, a TV show or a newspaper all have in common? They’re all compositions of information. When staring out the window, or looking at the photos on your wall, you’re consuming data about the world.

We surround ourselves with things to feel better. We hang photos of our friends on the wall, so that we’ll feel happy looking back on our past. We’re constantly using information from the past to feel better in the present.

I’ve always been at my best in low information rooms. White walls and only the things I require. I don’t want anything to disturb my process. It’s the same feeling I get in large open spaces, they somehow fail to segment the information in an interesting way. I just feel overwhelmed.
