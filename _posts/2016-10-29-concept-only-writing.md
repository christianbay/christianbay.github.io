title: Concept-only Writing
---
In writing we are encouraged to be somewhat verbose. Texts are to be of a certain length in order to fit the mould. It’s unnecessary delay the point for too long. Just give me the juice. I don’t want the fluff. It’s like with milk, I don’t want the cow, I just want the milk. That’s the idea behind Concept-only Writing (or COW). Just give me the concepts, short and succinct, and I’ll figure out for myself what they mean to me.
