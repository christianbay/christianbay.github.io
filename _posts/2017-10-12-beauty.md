Have I told you I love beauty? There's something about how everything
just clicks together. How traits continually are being selected while some die.
Beauty.. so sweet to your tongue, but with a bitter aftertaste. Beauty inspires, 
just to leave us wanting more, just to leave us insecure. This became some sort of a
poem. I didn't mean for it to. I just wanted to say that I love beauty. Try to
observe beauty as an impartial observant.
