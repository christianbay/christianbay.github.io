I just woke up. I read about someone living in a van, driving around the country, 
remote coding as a living. I like that idea. Sometimes I think that it would be
cool to live as a nomad coder. It's just that I like comfort too much. Maybe 
somtime.  
Today I want to keep working on my setup, and I want to do something about this
microblog. I don't know if I am happy using jekyll to host it, although it 
certainly is the simplest.
