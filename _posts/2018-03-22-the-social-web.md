What is the backbone of the next social web? A phone book.

In order to have a conversation, we need a location. A time and place. That's what a phone book is. The phonenumber next to John is a location. Such are all his addresses; IM or e-mail. They are locations in space where you can reach John.

Some people want to be contacted via e-mail, some via IM, others via SMS. Today we contact people via opening the platform on which we have them added. What if we started in the phone book instead, so that when I press John I use his prefered means of contact, that we both have in common. How would this work?

When I befriend John, we add one another to our phone books. John puts me in a group, such as "Acquaintance". John has decided that people in this group only get to see his e-mail address and phone number. He keeps his IM services for closer friends.

So great, we've invented the phone book. What's different? The difference is that a phone book entry is no longer a static representation of John on my phone. John has his card, which has all his information, all his groups and members of those groups. So instead of having to type the information into my phone, I just add him. 

I should probably explain this is further detail, but I'm getting impatient. I really want to start working on some SNMP stuff I'm doing. I'll pick up the slack at some point.
