I love this writing thing. Spamming out shit in my own tempo. I can get used to this.
I'm cooking some rice now. Ricealicious. Sooo delicious. Listening to [this playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/spotify/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX6kz6Kli3wib).
Chill out dinner is a winner.  
So, I've come up with a brilliant ploy to post to this blog. See, it is hosted on GitHub, and I have to actually commit the posts to a repository in order for them to show up here.
I want to post from an app on my phone, tablet or mac (Writer). I'll write files that will be stored in my Dropbox. I've created an application for Dropbox that will hit a server,
I'll download that file, format it properly, then commit it to GitHub. Voila motherfucker.  
If I'm really awesome, I'll get all of that to work tonight. Probably not. Maybe tomorrow. Anyway, I'll keep you posted. xoxo.
