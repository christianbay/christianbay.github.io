title: Just the concept

In writing we are encouraged to be somewhat verbose. Texts are to be of a certain length in order to fit the mould. 
But I’d prefer if you didn’t delay the point for too long. It’s like with milk, I don’t want the cow, I just want the milk.
 
That’s the idea behind concept-only writing. Just give me the concept, short and succinct, and let me figure out what it means to me.
