Oh. One more thing. A week ago I disabled notifications for Messenger and Snapchat.
I was hoping that this would help me relax and disconnect. It sort of has. But it's
still not good enough. I actually considered deleting Snapchat and Messenger, but
that seems over the top. They're fun *sometimes*. Any way, disabling notifications
is not enough, because now I have to go into the applications to see if I have any
new messages. This is annoying (and disappointing) when I don't have any new messages
(sad face). I guess I just need to be more disciplined. Move them to a sepparate screen,
keep badge count on (so I don't have to open the app), and then only check every 3-4 hours.
We'll see.
