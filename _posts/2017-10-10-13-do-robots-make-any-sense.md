title: Do robots make any sense?

Currently we are on the quest to create robots to replace human beings, but 
what is the main benefit of robots? We want to free up our time, so that we
can do 'other things'. What are these other things? We want more free time.
Free time to do what? It might seem that we believe there to be something
more to life than work, that work is not enough. That we need to be doing
something else, something fun. But what is fun? Is fun even fun, if it isn't
in contrast to something else? Isn't fun fun precisely because it isn't what 
we usually do? Doesn't fun just arise as a contrast to our work?  
Robots are just machines, like humans, but
more specialized and limited. We want robots because they lack sentience.
If robots felt bored, got hurt when people yelled at them, we wouldn't want
robots, because they'd suffer from what we believe to be the human condition. 
We want to avoid involving too many machines in this condition, because we 
recognize the imminent responsibility. We seek to create these machines to
relieve us from tasks we believe that we shouldn't be doing, but there is an
instrinic value judgement to this that is hard to balance, or even understand.  
We seem to have an idealized idea of what not having to work even mean.  
Remember, we need only pass time while entropy works its course. Peace.
