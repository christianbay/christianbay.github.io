I've given Emacs another try this week. This time I did it properly.  
I set up everything from scratch. Backed up my Spacemacs config, and let it all go.
Every time I start using Emacs I have a dream that this piece of software will do everything for me. It won't.  
So I'm back on my vim+tmux setup. I'll probably keep using org-mode in Spacemacs, like I used to. I'll write some more about this when I'm not supertired.  
  
Also, it's super annoying, because I'm struggling to get this site to order my posts based on the date+time they were created. No such luck yet. Going to bed.
