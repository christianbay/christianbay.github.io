Inspiration can be a dangerous thing. After getting inspired by someone,
I too often compare myself to them. When considering what I am doing,
stepping through scenarios, I try to see that same thing with their eyes.
Compare my habits, to their habits. Just now I was playing the piano,
and I was thinking: "but Jony Ive and Steve both work during the day time,
if they do most their work around other people, I should be able to do
that too". These are the perils of inspiration. Just because we get inspired,
we need to control just how much of their habits and thoughts we should
integrate into our own lives. Two lives are remarkably different,
and so they must be led.
