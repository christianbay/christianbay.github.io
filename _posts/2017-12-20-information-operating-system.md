The Information Operating System (IOS), is composed of three different parts. 

1. The document database
2. The user interface builder
3. The scraper

## Document database
All documents must be stored in a document-oriented database, since there will be no uniformity to the structure of these documents. They will need to be encrypted and distributed, as many of these documents will be stolen, and thus litigation might follow.

## User Interface Builder (UIB)
Models of types of information, such as a tweet (the containing object) and its comments (children), should be able to be dragged onto a canvas. Stylistically we should be able to dynamically change aspects of these two models (containing object and child), changing things such as typography, placement, organization etc. The UIB will allow you to structure, combine and consume information as you please, without any ads or distractions.

## Scraper
The scraper is software that is distributed to all participants in the network. The scraper runs on each node, polling information from all sorts of closed networks (Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, anything), encrypts this data and puts it in the document database, for every participating node to consume from. The goal is to extract every piece of information available on the Internet, and put it in the database.

We need this. We need information to be free and consumable. Information must be borrowed, organized and made available for all of the world to analyse.
