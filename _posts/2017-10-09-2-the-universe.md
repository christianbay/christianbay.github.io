title: The universe is profoundly sad
---
The universe, life, is profoundly sad
Here now, only to be erased,
By the razorblade of time

What are even dreams,
But nights cruel mistress,
Painting hope, on our days

And can we even move,
But in lock-step with it all?
Again, and again,
It comes to break my heart

I wrote this poem one about one year ago. I think it's the best I've ever written.
While listening to Written On The Sky by Max Richter it poured right out of me.
