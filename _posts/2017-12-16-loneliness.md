We don't necessarily understand what we do, we just do. Something attracts us, draws us in. We do it because we want to, because we feel like it. During, or years after, we can come up with reasons for it, but they are merely approximations. So it is with all that is established. We, for instance, hail democracy as the best solution, but neither of us has thought deeply about it. We do not understand all it's alternatives and variations, the way it curves and meets the specifications its creators laid out for it. We accept it. And  since it is not within the realm of man to understand everything, man must create in loneliness.
