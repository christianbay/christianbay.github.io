The main issue with this microblog? It's a pain in the ass to write on. If it was easier to post, I'd post more often. That means that this solution is crap. Like, I am actually editing posts manually. Copying files in the terminal, changing the date on them, adding meta-data once inside the files... This has got to stop.
