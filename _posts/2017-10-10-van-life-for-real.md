Have a look at this guys [website](https://ruby-on-wheels.github.io/). Now I really want to do van life.
He even has his own solar panles on the roof, and custom antennas for better 4G coverage. I'm doing van life
at some point! I need to get a remote job. I sort of have one, but I need to make the one I have more remote,
and then I need to get a programming gig. I'll contact some companies today. Am I really doing van life? Maybe.
  
I've been fixing a lot of stuff on this page today. Added a link to an about page in the footer. Now I just need
to make some sort of system for posting remotely. It's either the Writer iCloud/Dropbox thing, or just post
from e-mail. Posting from e-mail sounds alluring. Ok. I need breakfast.
