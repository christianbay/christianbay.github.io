I figured I'd start this up as a project to test Jekyll. The idea is for me to be able to write posts from my iPhone in Writer, add them to Dropbox and have some daemon that auto-uploads them here. Let's see how far I get with that.

I should be able to write some stuff in a post, publish it, and then edit it as I get new ideas pertaining to that post. I guess this is uncommon in the world of blogs, but that's just another reason that this probably isn't a traditional blog. The question is if I should have some sort of way to browse how the post has changed or something like that. It would be quite cool to have a slider or a commit log on the bottom that would allow you to see how the post has changed, but something tells me that that probably won't happen.
