I'm feeling great these days. I've lately been experimenting with different ways of mitigating the issues with my ability to concentrate. I just wanted to give a recap of what I'm doing.
 
## Sleep schedule
Lately, what I have found to be working is waking up at 5 AM. I go to bed at 7 PM, read for 2 hours until 9 PM, and then go to sleep for 8 hours. I work from 5 till around 10:30, go for a walk, and then work some more after I get back.

## Green tea
Tea has aided my concentration a lot. I've been off caffeine for nearly 5 years, so it was hard for me picking it up again, as I know how much work it is to quit. I am however now considering if it's something that can work for me.

## Nicotine
Yupp, not optimal this one. I've been off nicotine for about 6-7 years, so it was sort of dreadful starting again. I do however find that it aids my concentration. I'll experiment with using Nicorette chewing gum or nicotine pathes, instead of the snus (Scandinavian lip tobacco) that I'm using now.

## Food and supplements
I'm eating healthy(ier). I'm cutting down on the dairy and bread, to see if that can help. I've also started taking ZMA, which is a zinc, magnesium and Vitamin B supplement. I'm also planning to start taking Omega-3 supplements.

## Work
I'm working on a really cool side-project now, that I calling Space. Can't wait to share it!
