Day time is hard for me. I have no clue what to do. There are a lot of things
that I could be doing, but none of them are tempting. I feel weird in the day.
I actually had a period where I'd go to bed 08:00 and sleep till 16.00. Needless
to say, that was a programming period, where I didn't do anything else than write
software.  
I feel like shit in the day. It's hard to explain. My body isn't cooperating, it's
too bright, and I'm too aware of the fact that people are doing shit everywhere.
Outside, kids are screaming, I hear the sounds of roadworkers and all sorts of noisy
machinery. Also, I'm sort of uninspired. Thing is, the mornings are fine. Early 
mornings are OK. At least for working out, answering e-mails. Aha! It's the computer.
I don't like computers in the daytime. That's weird.
