Before going to bed last night, and this morning, I've been watching videos
about Steve Jobs. I've been interested in Apple's employees and their products
since I was 16 years old, but I haven't been thinking about it that much the
last years. As they became behemoths of popularity, I peered into other parts
of the world. It's good that I came back, though, because I had forgotten how
much Apple used to inspire me.  
When Jonathan Ive speaks of Steve, it's with an enamouration for his childlike
joy and sense of civic responsibility. Steve created the products because he 
felt like they needed to be perfect. Not because he wanted the admiration or
the cheque. I need that sort of inspiration. I need to see that other people
feel this way. It's what keeps me going. The feeling that
someone deeply cares about something, about a product.
