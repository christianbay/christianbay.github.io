        Van Life

    </h3>

    <p>I just woke up. I read about someone living in a van, driving around the country, 
remote coding as a living. I like that idea. Sometimes I think that it would be
cool to live as a nomad coder. It’s just that I like comfort too much. Maybe 
somtime.<br />
Today I want to keep working on my setup, and I want to do something about this
microblog. I don’t know if I am happy using jekyll to host it, although it 
certainly is the simplest.</p>

    <p>I’ve given Emacs another try this week. This time I did it properly.<br />
I set up everything from scratch. Backed up my Spacemacs config, and let it all go.
Every time I start using Emacs I have a dream that this piece of software will do everything for me. It won’t.<br />
So I’m back on my vim+tmux setup. I’ll probably keep using org-mode in Spacemacs, like I used to. I’ll write some more about this when I’m not supertired.</p>

<p>Also, it’s super annoying, because I’m struggling to get this site to order my posts based on the date+time they were created. No such luck yet. Going to bed.</p>

    </h3>

    <p>Have a look at this guys <a href="https://ruby-on-wheels.github.io/">website</a>. Now I really want to do van life.
He even has his own solar panles on the roof, and custom antennas for better 4G coverage. I’m doing van life
at some point! I need to get a remote job. I sort of have one, but I need to make the one I have more remote,
and then I need to get a programming gig. I’ll contact some companies today. Am I really doing van life? Maybe.</p>

<p>I’ve been fixing a lot of stuff on this page today. Added a link to an about page in the footer. Now I just need
to make some sort of system for posting remotely. It’s either the Writer iCloud/Dropbox thing, or just post
from e-mail. Posting from e-mail sounds alluring. Ok. I need breakfast.</p>

        System for posting
      </a>
    </h3>

    <p>Before I go to bed. I need to create some sort of system that will allow me to post from my phone etc.
I think I can do that with something like crontab polling my Dropbox/iCloud. Probably harder with iCloud,
but I really don’t want to go back to syncing my Writer documents on Dropbox. Actually, that isn’t happening.</p>

<p>You know what’s going to be painful? Having to manually control the damn line-breaks. Whatever. I’ll get used to it (or find a workaround).</p>

        The Universe
      </a>
    </h3>

    <p>The universe, life, is profoundly sad<br />
Here now, only to be erased,<br />
By the razorblade of time</p>

<p>What are even dreams,<br />
But nights cruel mistress,<br />
Painting hope, on our days</p>

<p>Can we even move,<br />
But in lock-step with it all<br />
Again – and again,<br />
It comes to break my heart</p>

<p>I wrote this poem about one year ago. I think it’s the best I’ve ever written.<br />
Listening to Written On The Sky by Max Richter it sprung into existense.</p>
