   <title>The Next Big Thing</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In Zero To One, Peter Thiel claims that the next Facebook won’t be a social network.
I think the next big thing won’t even be a company. We’re constantly thinking about
companies, about profit. Well guess what, I’m tired of profit. We don’t need more money.
Individuals do not need a lot of money. We don’t need most of the stuff we consume.
It’s a system that feeds itself. We use advertising to make people desire things, so
that we can do a wealth transfer between individuals. People do not actually want those
things, you are tricking them into wanting it. Ok, so fuck companies. It’s all rotten.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s next? Something that isn’t a company. Is it a non-profit? Perhaps, but not the
kind of non-profit we see today. I think something in between. Non-profits that sell
things and generate revenue, but that don’t make any profit. Now that’s interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I need to work out. Later.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Have a look at this guys &lt;a href=&quot;https://ruby-on-wheels.github.io/&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;. Now I really want to do van life.
He even has his own solar panles on the roof, and custom antennas for better 4G coverage. I’m doing van life
at some point! I need to get a remote job. I sort of have one, but I need to make the one I have more remote,
and then I need to get a programming gig. I’ll contact some companies today. Am I really doing van life? Maybe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been fixing a lot of stuff on this page today. Added a link to an about page in the footer. Now I just need
to make some sort of system for posting remotely. It’s either the Writer iCloud/Dropbox thing, or just post
from e-mail. Posting from e-mail sounds alluring. Ok. I need breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Van Life</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I just woke up. I read about someone living in a van, driving around the country, 
remote coding as a living. I like that idea. Sometimes I think that it would be
cool to live as a nomad coder. It’s just that I like comfort too much. Maybe 
somtime.&lt;br /&gt;
Today I want to keep working on my setup, and I want to do something about this
microblog. I don’t know if I am happy using jekyll to host it, although it 
certainly is the simplest.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Emacs</title>

   <id>http://valleybay.github.io/2017/10/09/emacs</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve given Emacs another try this week. This time I did it properly.&lt;br /&gt;
I set up everything from scratch. Backed up my Spacemacs config, and let it all go.
Every time I start using Emacs I have a dream that this piece of software will do everything for me. It won’t.&lt;br /&gt;
So I’m back on my vim+tmux setup. I’ll probably keep using org-mode in Spacemacs, like I used to. I’ll write some more about this when I’m not supertired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, it’s super annoying, because I’m struggling to get this site to order my posts based on the date+time they were created. No such luck yet. Going to bed.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>System for posting</title>

   <id>http://valleybay.github.io/2017/10/09/system-for-posting</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Before I go to bed. I need to create some sort of system that will allow me to post from my phone etc.
I think I can do that with something like crontab polling my Dropbox/iCloud. Probably harder with iCloud,
but I really don’t want to go back to syncing my Writer documents on Dropbox. Actually, that isn’t happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know what’s going to be painful? Having to manually control the damn line-breaks. Whatever. I’ll get used to it (or find a workaround).&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Universe</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The universe, life, is profoundly sad&lt;br /&gt;
Here now, only to be erased,&lt;br /&gt;
By the razorblade of time&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are even dreams,&lt;br /&gt;
But nights cruel mistress,&lt;br /&gt;
Painting hope, on our days&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can we even move,&lt;br /&gt;
But in lock-step with it all&lt;br /&gt;
Again – and again,&lt;br /&gt;
It comes to break my heart&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote this poem about one year ago. I think it’s the best I’ve ever written.&lt;br /&gt;
Listening to Written On The Sky by Max Richter it sprung into existense.&lt;/p&gt;
