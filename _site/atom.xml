   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In writing we are encouraged to be somewhat verbose. Texts are to be of a certain length in order to fit the mould. It’s unnecessary delay the point for too long. Just give me the juice. I don’t want the fluff. It’s like with milk, I don’t want the cow, I just want the milk. That’s the idea behind Concept-only Writing (or COW). Just give me the concepts, short and succinct, and I’ll figure out for myself what they mean to me.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>What and Why</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve been thinking of writing for some time, it’s just that I never get started. When I do get started, I never finish what I write, and that’s exactly what I intend on doing here: never get started and never finish what I start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve recently started sharing my thoughts on Twitter. Thing is, tweets are too short and tweets are too permanent. I also briefly experimented with Medium, but quickly found it too noisy, so here we are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This site is simply a place for me to beam ideas and thoughts from my phone to your brain. Do not expect well written stuff here, and don’t be surprised if the posts are littered with typos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as why, I’m just sharing my thoughts because I think some of them are interesting. If you’d like to have a chat about anything you read here just shoot me a message on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a final disclaimer I should say that I plan on adding or removing from any of these posts without any indication of doing so. All prior versions are however checked into a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/valleybay/valleybay.github.io&quot;&gt;git repository&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
