   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve been thinking of writing for some time, it’s just that I never get started. When I do get started, I never finish what I write, and that’s exactly what I intend on doing here: never get started and never finish what I start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve recently started sharing my thoughts on Twitter. Thing is, tweets are too short and tweets are too permanent. I also briefly experimented with Medium, but quickly found it too noisy, so here we are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This site is simply a place for me to beam ideas and thoughts from my phone to your brain. Do not expect well written stuff here, and don’t be surprised if the posts are littered with typos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as why, I’m just sharing my thoughts because I think some of them are interesting. If you’d like to have a chat about anything you read here just shoot me a message on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a final disclaimer I should say that I plan on adding or removing from any of these posts without any indication of doing so. All prior versions are however checked into a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/valleybay/valleybay.github.io&quot;&gt;git repository&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
