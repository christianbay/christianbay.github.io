   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;What does a view, a picture on the wall, a TV show or a newspaper all have in common? They’re all compositions of information. When staring out the window, or looking at the photos on your wall, you’re consuming data about the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We surround ourselves with things to feel better. We hang photos of our friends on the wall, so that we’ll feel happy looking back on our past. We’re constantly using information from the past to feel better in the present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve always been at my best in low information rooms. White walls and only the things I require. I don’t want anything to disturb my process. It’s the same feeling I get in large open spaces, they somehow fail to segment the information in an interesting way. I just feel overwhelmed.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Just the concept, please</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In writing we are encouraged to be somewhat verbose. Texts are to be of a certain length in order to fit the mould. 
But I’d prefer if you didn’t delay the point for too long. It’s like with milk, I don’t want the cow, I just want the milk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s the idea behind concept-only writing. Just give me the concepts, short and succinct, and let me figure out what it means to me.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>What and Why</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve been thinking of writing for some time, it’s just that I never get started. When I do get started, I never finish what I write, and that’s exactly what I intend on doing here: never get started and never finish what I start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve recently started sharing my thoughts on Twitter. Thing is, tweets are too short and tweets are too permanent. I also briefly experimented with Medium, but quickly found it too noisy, so here we are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This site is simply a place for me to beam ideas and thoughts from my phone to your brain. Do not expect well written stuff here, and don’t be surprised if the posts are littered with typos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for why, I’m just sharing my thoughts because I think some of them are interesting. If you’d like to have a chat about anything you read here, message me &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/chrisvalleybay&quot;&gt;@chrisvalleybay&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a final disclaimer I should say that I plan on adding or removing from any of these posts without any indication of doing so. All prior versions are however checked into a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/valleybay/valleybay.github.io&quot;&gt;git repository&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
